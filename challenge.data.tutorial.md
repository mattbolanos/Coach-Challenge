Extract the tables from the pdf. The NBA unfortunately formats this data
as a pdf of an excel sheet, so there is work to be done to scrape and
clean it.

    dat <- extract_tables("https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/05/Coachs-Challenge-reviews-1.pdf",
                          method = "stream", guess = T, columns = list(c(11)))

Here we are binding all of the 14 pages of the pdf, adding column names,
and cleaning up the date column.

    df <- smartbind(as.data.frame(dat[1]), as.data.frame(dat[2]),
                    as.data.frame(dat[3]), as.data.frame(dat[4]),
                    as.data.frame(dat[5]), as.data.frame(dat[6]),
                    as.data.frame(dat[7]), as.data.frame(dat[8]),
                    as.data.frame(dat[9]), as.data.frame(dat[10]),
                    as.data.frame(dat[11]), as.data.frame(dat[12]),
                    as.data.frame(dat[13]), as.data.frame(dat[14]))

    df <- df %>% 
      row_to_names(row_number = 1) %>%
      clean_names() 

    ## Warning in row_to_names(., row_number = 1): Row 1 does not provide unique names.
    ## Consider running clean_names() after row_to_names().

    df$date <- as.Date(df$date, format =  "%m/%d/%Y")

The first page required additional parsing methods, so we will save it
as a separate dataframe before combining it with the rest.

    first_page <- df %>%
      filter(date < "2021-01-01") %>%
      mutate(
        away_team = trimws(
          substr(away_t_heoame_t_ineiatmial_call_challenged, 1, 4),
          "right"
        ),
        home_team = substr(away_t_heoame_t_ineiatmial_call_challenged, 5, 7),
        initial_call = substr(

WARNING: Very large case\_when statement ahead. Due to the format of the
data, as you may have gathered from the previous chunk, there are a lot
of typos and discrepancies when parsing this pdf file. Below creates the
final clean data frame. Enjoy!
